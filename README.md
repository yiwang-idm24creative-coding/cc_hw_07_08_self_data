Prompt: dating culture

My long-term stay in New York adds up to three years, and also dating culture with dating app has been more and more popular in my country but I haven't tried it before. Because I preferred to know about people by chance not for purpose, and it's a little tricky for me to connect with people that I never met. I'm thinking about make some new change and new life maybe. With my friend encouragement, I just download the Hinge and set up profile on Sunday. I just came up with why cannot collect the data from Hinge so that I could  know more about the dating culture and whether I could accept this.
Critically think about if the app makes people as merchandise? the love appears with algorithm?
